DNA Methylation Ageing Atlas â€“ Preprocessing Code

This repository contains example code and workflows used in the DNA methylation ageing atlas project. The scripts demonstrate key steps in data preprocessing, curation, and quality control, covering both open-access datasets and collaborator-contributed data.

The goal of this repository is to provide a transparent and reproducible framework for preparing DNA methylation data prior to downstream analyses. The code highlights approaches for:

Cleaning and harmonizing data from multiple sources

Filtering and quality assessment of CpG sites and samples

Normalization and batch correction strategies

Metadata integration and annotation for ageing-focused analyses

While the data itself is not included, these examples serve as a guide for researchers interested in applying similar methods to their own datasets or in reproducing aspects of the ageing atlas study.
